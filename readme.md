Note on Model Performance

This project is intentionally developed as a beginner-level implementation of a regression model.
The main objective is to understand the ML pipeline rather than achieve high predictive accuracy.

The current model performance is as follows:

R² Score: 0.47
RMSE: approximately -10,500

These results are expected at this stage, since:

*Only basic preprocessing techniques were applied
*A limited number of features were used
*A simple linear regression model was chosen
*No advanced feature engineering or tuning was performed

As the project evolves, applying methods such as feature engineering, regularization (Ridge/Lasso), or tree-based algorithms can significantly improve model accuracy
